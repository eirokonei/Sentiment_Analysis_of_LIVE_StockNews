# Sentiment Analysis of LIVE Stock News

This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. <br> 
The ultimate goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment of stock news(LIVE) for stock price prediction. <br> For example: Currently, the stock price of a tech giant company will either increase or decrease or stay the same. <br>
WEB SCRAPING has been used to get LIVE stock news (basically news headlines) from https://finviz.com/. <br>
I have taken news of Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft. <br>

### `Coding Steps`

1. Import necessary libraries. <br>
  1.1. BeautifulSoup, matplotlib, pandas, nltk, etc.
2. Web Scraping.
3. Parsing the data.
4. Analyze sentiment.
